Physical samples are represented by a digital record.

Each digital record is addressable by at least one identifier that is unique to the record.

A collection of digital records can be represented by a list of the record identifiers.

A list of all physical sample digital record identifiers (global record list) can be constructed from the collection lists.

Digital records may be presented in different serializations (media type).

Digital records of a serialization may present different views of the same information (profile).

iSamples has defined a profile applicable to all physical samples.

iSamples has defined a programmatic interface
