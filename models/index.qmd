## Taxonomies

The iSamples core taxonomies are controlled vocabularies with terms related by [`SKOS:broader`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#broader) and [`SKOS:narrower`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#narrower). In order to be domain agnostic, the core taxonomies cover a small set of top level terms. The taxonomies may be extended as necessary to support more specialized domains by relating additional terms using `SKOS:broader` and `SKOS:narrower`.

The iSamples taxonomies are used to characterize three fundamental concepts pertaining to physical samples:

1. The "iSamples Materials vocabulary" is a taxonomy of terms used to categorize the composition of a physical sample, that is "What material is the sample composed of?"
2. The "Sampled Feature Type Vocabulary" is a taxonomy of terms used to indicate what the sample is representative of.
3. The "iSamples Specimen Type Vocabulary" is a taxonomy of broad categories that classify what type of spcimen the physical sample record represents.

Three taxonomies are currently defined :
