## Taxonomies

The iSamples core taxonomies are controlled vocabularies with terms related by [`SKOS:broader`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#broader) and [`SKOS:narrower`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#narrower). In order to be domain agnostic, the core taxonomies cover a small set of top level terms. The taxonomies may be extended as necessary to support more specialized domains by relating additional terms using `SKOS:broader` and `SKOS:narrower`.

The iSamples taxonomies are used to characterize three fundamental concepts pertaining to physical samples:

1. What material is the sample composed of?
2. What feature is the sample representative of?
3. What kind of thing is the sample?

Three taxonomies are currently defined :
