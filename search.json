The basic rule is thus, the path element reference is used to reference a specific document, then a fragment is used to reference a specific component of the document.\nThe requested content type is presented by a client in the Accept header.

Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved.

    "text": "Project Objectives\n\nDesign and develop iSamples infrastructure (iSamples in a Box and iSamples Central);\nBuild four initial implementations of iSamples for adoption and use case testing (Open Context, GEOME, SESAR, and Smithsonian Institution);\nConduct outreach and community engagement to developers, individual researchers, and international organizations concerned with material samples.\n\n\n\n\niSamples diagram\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nResearch frequently uses material samples as a basic element for reference, study, and experimentation in many scientific disciplines, especially in the natural and environmental sciences, material sciences, agriculture, physical anthropology, archaeology, and biomedicine. Observations made on samples collected in the field and in the laboratory constitute a critical data resource for research that addresses grand challenges of our planet’s future sustainability, from environmental change; to food, energy, and water resources; to natural hazards and their mitigation; to public health. The large investments of public funds being made to curate huge volumes of samples acquired over decades or even centuries, and to collect and analyze new samples demand these samples to be openly accessible, easily discoverable, and documented with sufficient information to make them reusable. The current ecosystem of sample and sample data management in the U.S. and globally is highly fragmented across stakeholders, including museums, federal agencies, academic institutions, and individual researchers, with a multitude of institutional and discipline-specific catalogs, practices for sample identification, and protocols for describing samples.\nThe iSamples project is a multi-disciplinary collaboration that will develop a national digital infrastructure that will provide services for globally unique, consistent, and convenient identification of material samples; metadata about them; and linking them to other samples, derived data, and research results published in the literature. iSamples builds on previous initiatives to achieve this by providing material samples with globally unique, persistent identifiers that reliably link to landing pages with metadata describing the sample and its provenance, and which allow unambiguously linking samples with data and publications.\nLeveraging significant national investments, iSamples provides the missing link among:\n\nphysical collections (e.g., natural history museums, herbaria, biobanks),\nfield stations, marine laboratories, long-term ecological research sites, and observatories, and\ndata repositories and cyberinfrastructure. iSamples delivers enhanced infrastructure for STEM research and education, decision-makers, and the general public.\n\niSamples benefits national security and resource management by offering a means to assure sample provenance, improving scientific reproducibility and demonstrating compliance with ethical standards, national regulations, and international treaties, (e.g., automated audits of sensitive archaeological specimens, endangered species, or specimens containing controlled substances).\n\n\nTechnical perspective\nThe iSamples project will:\n\nCreate a flexible and scalable architecture to ensure broad adoption and implementation by diverse stakeholders.\nBuild upon on existing identifier infrastructure such as IGSNs (Global Sample Number;) and ARKs (Archival Resource Keys), but is agnostic to identifier type.\nEncourage a high-level metadata standard for natural history samples (across biosciences, geosciences, and archaeology), while supporting community-developed metadata standards in specialist domains.\nExtend existing capabilities, enhance consistency, and expand their reach to serve science and society much more broadly through integration with established discipline-specific infrastructure at the System for Earth Sample Registration SESAR (geoscience), CyVerse (bioscience), Open Context (archaeology), and the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n\n\nPrincipal Investigators\n\nKerstin Lehnert, Columbia University\nRamona Walls, University of Arizona\nNeil Davies, The Regents of the University of California, Berkeley\nDavid Vieglais, University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute"

In order to be domain agnostic, these core taxonomies cover a small set of top level terms. The taxonomies may be extended as necessary to support more specialized domains by relating additional terms using SKOS:broader and SKOS:narrower.\nThree taxonomies are currently defined:"

(1995), The definition of a mineral, The Canadian Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689–90). Include mineraloids. … A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256). Comment: the identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples: obsidian, Opal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid)"

The fragments may be held together by a mineral cement or in a fine-grained matrix, and consolidated or nonconsolidated. Clasts may be of any composition or origin. In sedimentary environments, breccia is used for material that consists entirely of angular fragments, mostly derived from a single source rock body, as in a rock avalanche deposit, and matrix is interpreted to be the product of comminution of clasts during transport. Diamictite or diamicton is used when the material reflects mixing of rock from a variety of sources, some sub angular or subrounded clasts may be present, and matrix is pre-existing fine grained material that is not a direct product of the brecciation/deposition process."

If chemical data are not available, the color index is used to distinguish the categories, with basalt defined to contain greater than 35 percent mafic minerals by volume or greater than 40 percent mafic minerals by weight. Typically consists of plagioclase (frequently zoned from labradorite to oligoclase), pyroxene, hornblende and/or biotite. Fine grained equivalent of dioritic rock."

Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved.
