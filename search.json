    "text": "Background\nResearch frequently uses material samples as a basic element for reference, study, and experimentation in many scientific disciplines, especially in the natural and environmental sciences, material sciences, agriculture, physical anthropology, archaeology, and biomedicine. Observations made on samples collected in the field and in the laboratory constitute a critical data resource for research that addresses grand challenges of our planet’s future sustainability, from environmental change; to food, energy, and water resources; to natural hazards and their mitigation; to public health. The large investments of public funds being made to curate huge volumes of samples acquired over decades or even centuries, and to collect and analyze new samples demand these samples to be openly accessible, easily discoverable, and documented with sufficient information to make them reusable. The current ecosystem of sample and sample data management in the U.S. and globally is highly fragmented across stakeholders, including museums, federal agencies, academic institutions, and individual researchers, with a multitude of institutional and discipline-specific catalogs, practices for sample identification, and protocols for describing samples.\nThe iSamples project is a multi-disciplinary collaboration that will develop a national digital infrastructure that will provide services for globally unique, consistent, and convenient identification of material samples; metadata about them; and linking them to other samples, derived data, and research results published in the literature. iSamples builds on previous initiatives to achieve this by providing material samples with globally unique, persistent identifiers that reliably link to landing pages with metadata describing the sample and its provenance, and which allow unambiguously linking samples with data and publications.\nLeveraging significant national investments, iSamples provides the missing link among:\n\nphysical collections (e.g., natural history museums, herbaria, biobanks),\nfield stations, marine laboratories, long-term ecological research sites, and observatories, and\ndata repositories and cyberinfrastructure. iSamples delivers enhanced infrastructure for STEM research and education, decision-makers, and the general public.\n\niSamples benefits national security and resource management by offering a means to assure sample provenance, improving scientific reproducibility and demonstrating compliance with ethical standards, national regulations, and international treaties, (e.g., automated audits of sensitive archaeological specimens, endangered species, or specimens containing controlled substances).\n\n\nTechnical perspective\nThe iSamples project will:\n\nCreate a flexible and scalable architecture to ensure broad adoption and implementation by diverse stakeholders.\nBuild upon on existing identifier infrastructure such as IGSNs (Global Sample Number;) and ARKs (Archival Resource Keys), but is agnostic to identifier type.\nEncourage a high-level metadata standard for natural history samples (across biosciences, geosciences, and archaeology), while supporting community-developed metadata standards in specialist domains.\nExtend existing capabilities, enhance consistency, and expand their reach to serve science and society much more broadly through integration with established discipline-specific infrastructure at the System for Earth Sample Registration SESAR (geoscience), CyVerse (bioscience), Open Context (archaeology), and the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n\n\nPrincipal Investigators\n\nKerstin Lehnert, Columbia University\nRamona Walls, University of Arizona\nNeil Davies, The Regents of the University of California, Berkeley\nDavid Vieglais, University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute"

    "text": "Namespaces are used to uniquely address resources offered by the project.\nIn order to support introspection, all namespace IRIs are to be resolvable. Resolution involves three variables: the IRI, the requested content type, and an optional profile.\nThe IRI provides the location of the resource. Reference to specific items within a resource can be made in two ways: by path (e.g. /resource/element) and by fragment (e.g. resource#element). IRI fragments are not transmitted to a server by a client, hence a fragment identifier is always relative to the retrieved document. The basic rule is thus, the path element reference is used to reference a specific document, then a fragment is used to reference a specific component of the document.\nThe requested content type is presented by a client in the Accept header. If no Accept header is presented by the client or the Accept header is ambiguous (e.g. */*), then the default content type is returned. If a specific content type can not be matched, then a 406 Not Acceptable status is returned.\n\n\n\nIRI\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isamples/\n\n\nThe namespace base provides the root for project IRIs. The project will utilize the w3id.org infrastructure to enable abstraction of the advertised location and the physical location of the resource. Such abstraction is especially important early in the project as locations of resources are in flux.\n\n\n\nThe default format for definitions is JSON-LD. Other formats may be requested using the Accept header.\n\nIRI\n\niss: <https://w3id.org/isamples/models/>\n\n\nDefinitions include static content such as vocabularies, ontologies, schemas, and other documents providing machine and human actionable documents describing resources.\n\nVocabularies\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isamples/models/vocab/\n\nSpecimen Type Vocabulary:\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isamples/models/vocab/specimen_type/\n\nSampled Feature Vocabulary:\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isamples/models/vocab/sampled_feature/\n\nMaterial Type Vocabulary:\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isamples/models/vocab/material_type/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIRI\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isamples/svc/\n\n\n\n\n\nIRI\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isamples/svc/meta/"

    "text": "Physical specimen\n\nConcept: physicalspecimen\ntop concept in specimen type hierarchy. Represents any physical specimen.\n\nAny aggregation specimen\n\nConcept: anyaggregation\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSample consists of a bunch of material fragments, not related to the same object (e.g. not a bunch of broken pot sherds that might be reassembled), but taken together representative of the sampled feature. Examples: loose soil, sediment, crushed rock, particulate, bunches of unrelated pot sherd, human production waste, filtrates and residues. The sample requires some kind of container to keep it together. Cores of loosely consolidated material are considered ‘piece of solid material’ because the internal parts have spatial relationships (e.g. upper part, lower part).\n\nAnthropogenic aggregation\n\nConcept: anthropogenicaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation\nAggregation consists of fragments of material produced by human activity, not described individually, and generally not all originating from the same object. Includes pottery in an excavation unit that gets an aggregate description, production waste, production raw-materials, or other residues (broken bits of plaster from an destroyed wall), synthetic powders.\n\n\nBiome aggregation specimen\n\nConcept: biomeaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen is an aggregation of whole or fragmentary parts of multiple organisms, microscopic or megascopic, representative of some site.\n\n\nAggregation\n\nConcept: genericaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation\nAn aggregate specimen that is not biogenic or composed of anthropogenic material fragments. Examples: loose soil or sediment (e.g. in a bag), rock chips, particulate filtrate or precipitate; rock powders.\n\n\n\nArtifact\n\nConcept: artifact\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nAn object made (manufactured, shaped, modified) by a human being, or precursor hominid. Include a set of pieces belonging originally to a single object and treated as a single specimen.\n\n\nAny biological specimen\n\nConcept: biologicalspecimen\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen for which the sampled feature is one or more living organisms from a particular biome context, megascopic or microscopic\n\nBiome aggregation specimen\n\nConcept: biomeaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen is an aggregation of whole or fragmentary parts of multiple organisms, microscopic or megascopic, representative of some site.\n\n\nOrganism part\n\nConcept: organismpart\nChild of: biologicalspecimen\nPart of an organism, e.g. a tissue sample, plant leaf, flower, bird feather. Include internal parts not composed of organic material (e.g. teeth, bone), and hard body parts that are not shed (hoof, horn, tusk, claw). Hair is tricky, include here for now. Does not necessarily imply existance of parent sample. Not fossilized; generally includes organism parts native to deposits of Holocene to Recent age.\n\n\nOrganism product\n\nConcept: organismproduct\nChild of: biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen is a thing produced by some organism, generally not composed of organic material or including biological tissue, e.g. Shell, antler, egg shell, coral skeleton (organic tissue not included), fecal matter, cocoon, web. Consider internal parts not composed of organic material (e.g. teeth, bone) and hard body parts that are not shed (hoof, horn, tusk) to be organism parts.\n\n\nWhole organism specimen\n\nConcept: wholeorganism\nChild of: biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen consists of the bodies of one or more entire organisms of the same species, from any kingdom. Note that are also ‘solid object’\n\n\n\nFossil\n\nConcept: fossil\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen is the remains of one or more organisms preserved in rock; includes whole body, body parts (usually bone or shell), and trace fossils. An organism or organism part becomes a fossil when it has undergone some fossilization process that generally entails physical and chemical changes akin to diagenesis in a sedimentary rock. Trace fossils are manifestations of biologic activity preserved in a rock body (typically sedimentary), without included preserved body parts.\n\n\nLiquid or gas\n\nConcept: liquidorgas\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nLiquid, gas, or mixed dominantly fluid phases, necessarily in some kind of container to maintain identity. Might include minor solid particles. Container typically human made, but also includes natural fluid container, e.g. fluid inclusion in a mineral grain. Includes colloids, foams, gels, suspensions. The sampled feature is the fluid substance; fluid samples collected to analyze the contained biome should be considered Biome Aggregation\n\n\nOther solid object\n\nConcept: othersolidobject\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSingle piece of material not one of the other types, e.g. rock specimen, mineral specimen, core. Ice and permafrost are considered solid materials.\n\n\nResearch product\n\nConcept: researchproduct\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen is a product of some research workflow, e.g. a thin section, an XRF pellet, a grain mount, SEM stub, synthetic rock or mineral … In general there should be a link to a parent specimen from which this was derived. Might be aggregation (e.g. a synthetic material powder) or a solid object.\n\nAnalytical preparation\n\nConcept: analyticalpreparation\nChild of: researchproduct\nSpecimen is a product of processing required for some observation procedure, e.g. thin section, XRF bead, SEM stub, rock powder. If identified separately, this should have a ‘parent’ link to the original sample\n\n\nExperiment product\n\nConcept: experimentalproduct\nChild of: researchproduct\nSpecimen is product of an experimental procedure (e.g. synthetic material)"

Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal). c.f. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001069\n\n\nAnthropogenic material\n\nConcept: otheranthropogenicmaterial\nChild of: anyanthropogenicmaterial\nNon-metallic material produced by human activity. Organic products of agricultural activity are both anthropogenic and organic. Include lab preparations like XRF pellet and rock powders. Examples: ceramics, concrete, slag, (anthropogenic) glass, mine tailing, plaster, waste.\n\n\n\nAny ice\n\nConcept: anyice\nChild of: material\na solid material that is normally a liquid or gas at Standard Temperature and Pressre (STP) that is in a solid state under the observed temperature and pressure conditions.\n\nFrozen water\n\nConcept: waterice\nChild of: anyice\nWater that is in a solid state.\n\n\n\nBiogenic non-organic material\n\nConcept: biogenicnonorganicmaterial\nChild of: material\nMaterial produced by an organism but not composed of ‘very large molecules of biological origin.’ E.g. bone, tooth, shell, coral skeleton,\n\n\nDispersed media\n\nConcept: dispersedmedia\nChild of: material\nA material contains discrete elements of one medium that are dispersed in a continuous fluid medium. The dispersed component can be a gas, a liquid or a solid (based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersed_media). Does not include mixtures of granular material like soil, sediment, particulate, or solids that would be considered a rock. E.g. aerosol ENVO_00010505, foam ENVO_00005738, emulsion ENVO_00010506, colloidal suspension ENVO_01001560, scum(?)ENVO:00003930, clathrate?\n\n\nNatural Solid Material\n\nConcept: earthmaterial\nChild of: material\nUndifferentiated, soil, sediment, rock, or natural particulates. Typically (nessarily?) a granular aggregate that might include any of the previous constiturents. Use for Earth Material aggregates of uncertain origin\n\nMineral\n\nConcept: mineral\nChild of: earthmaterial\nMaterial consists of a single mineral or mineraloid phase. . ‘A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes.’ (Nickel, Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral, The Canadian Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689–90). Include mineraloids. … A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256). Comment: the identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples: obsidian, Opal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid)\n\n\nMixed soil, sediment or rock\n\nConcept: mixedsoilsedimentrock\nChild of: earthmaterial\nMaterial is mixed aggregation of fragments of undifferentiated soil, sediment or rock origin. e.g. cuttings from some boreholes (rock fragments and caved soil or sediment), sea floor dredge haul (mixed sediment and rock)\n\n\nParticulate\n\nConcept: particulate\nChild of: earthmaterial\nMaterial consists of microscopic particulate material derived by precipitation, filtering, or settling from suspension in a fluid, e.g. filtrate from water, deposition from atmosphere, astro material particles. Might include mineral, organic, or biological material. ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has “composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material.”, refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO. Human manufactured particulates (e.g. rock powder) should be categorized as ‘anthropogenic material’\n\n\nRock\n\nConcept: rock\nChild of: earthmaterial\nConsolidated aggregate of particles (grains) of rock, mineral (including native elements), mineraloid, or solid organic material. Includes mineral aggregates such as granite, shale, marble; natural glass such as obsidian; organic material formed by geologic processes such a coal; extraterrestrial material in meteorites; and crushed rock fragments like drill cuttings from rock. (based on http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/rock, same as http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001995)\nSee Also:\n\nobo:ENVO_00001995\n<http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/rock>\n\n\n\nSediment\n\nConcept: sediment\nChild of: earthmaterial\nSolid granular material transported by wind, water, or gravity, not modified by interaction with biosphere or atmosphere (to differentiate from soil). Particles derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, or precipitated chemically in the surficial environment (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment). Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. Particulate constituents of a compound material do not adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be considered a solid material in its own right.(http:// resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/consolidationdegree/consolidated) . Similar to http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002007\n\n\nSoil\n\nConcept: soil\nChild of: earthmaterial\nMixed granular mineral and organic matter modified by interaction between earth material, biosphere, and atmosphere, consisting mostly of varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) Soil consists of horizons near the Earth’s surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/ portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280) (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001998)\nSee Also:\n\n<http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280>\n\n\n\n\nFluid material\n\nConcept: fluid\nChild of: material\na substance that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress, or external force. Fluids are a phase of matter and include liquids, gases and plasmas. They are substances with zero shear modulus, or, in simpler terms, substances that cannot resist any shear force applied to them. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid)\n\nGaseous material\n\nConcept: gas\nChild of: fluid\nMaterial composed of one or more chemical entities that has neither independent shape nor volume but tends to expand indefinitely (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000797). Infer that the sample is curated in some kind of container.\n\n\nLiquid water\n\nConcept: liquidwater\nChild of: fluid\nA material primarily composed of dihydrogen oxide in its liquid form; infer that the sample is curated in some kind of container.\n\n\nNon-aqueous liquid material\n\nConcept: nonaqueousliquid\nChild of: fluid\nLiquid composed dominantly of material other than water. Includes liquids that do not fit in any other category. E.g. alcohol, petroleum.\n\n\n\nOrganic material\n\nConcept: organicmaterial\nChild of: material\nEnvironmental material derived from living organisms and composed primarily of one or more very large molecules of biological origin. Examples: body (animal or plant), body part, fecal matter, seeds, wood, tissue, biological fluids, biological waste, algal material, biofilm, necromass, plankton. source: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000155"
