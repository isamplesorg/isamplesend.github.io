Observations made on samples collected in the field and in the laboratory constitute a critical data resource for research that addresses grand challenges of our planet’s future sustainability, from environmental change; to food, energy, and water resources; to natural hazards and their mitigation; to public health. The large investments of public funds being made to curate huge volumes of samples acquired over decades or even centuries, and to collect and analyze new samples demand these samples to be openly accessible, easily discoverable, and documented with sufficient information to make them reusable. The current ecosystem of sample and sample data management in the U.S. and globally is highly fragmented across stakeholders, including museums, federal agencies, academic institutions, and individual researchers, with a multitude of institutional and discipline-specific catalogs, practices for sample identification, and protocols for describing samples.\nThe iSamples project is a multi-disciplinary collaboration that will develop a national digital infrastructure that will provide services for globally unique, consistent, and convenient identification of material samples; metadata about them; and linking them to other samples, derived data, and research results published in the literature. iSamples builds on previous initiatives to achieve this by providing material samples with globally unique, persistent identifiers that reliably link to landing pages with metadata describing the sample and its provenance, and which allow unambiguously linking samples with data and publications.\nLeveraging significant national investments, iSamples provides the missing link among:\n\nphysical collections (e.g., natural history museums, herbaria, biobanks),\nfield stations, marine laboratories, long-term ecological research sites, and observatories, and\ndata repositories and cyberinfrastructure. iSamples delivers enhanced infrastructure for STEM research and education, decision-makers, and the general public.\n\niSamples benefits national security and resource management by offering a means to assure sample provenance, improving scientific reproducibility and demonstrating compliance with ethical standards, national regulations, and international treaties, (e.g., automated audits of sensitive archaeological specimens, endangered species, or specimens containing controlled substances).\n\n\nTechnical perspective\nThe iSamples project will:\n\nCreate a flexible and scalable architecture to ensure broad adoption and implementation by diverse stakeholders.\nBuild upon on existing identifier infrastructure such as IGSNs (Global Sample Number;) and ARKs (Archival Resource Keys), but is agnostic to identifier type.\nEncourage a high-level metadata standard for natural history samples (across biosciences, geosciences, and archaeology), while supporting community-developed metadata standards in specialist domains.\nExtend existing capabilities, enhance consistency, and expand their reach to serve science and society much more broadly through integration with established discipline-specific infrastructure at the System for Earth Sample Registration SESAR (geoscience), CyVerse (bioscience), Open Context (archaeology), and the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n\n\nPrincipal Investigators\n\nKerstin Lehnert, Columbia University\nRamona Walls, University of Arizona\nNeil Davies, The Regents of the University of California, Berkeley\nDavid Vieglais, University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute"

There are three core vocabularies for different aspects of sample type: material sample type, material type, and sampled feature type. Each vocabulary is maintained as an RDF file using the SKOS vocabulary, with hierarchical relationships using SKOS:broader. In order to be domain agnostic, these core taxonomies cover a small set of top level terms. The taxonomies may be extended as necessary to support more specialized domains by relating additional terms using SKOS:broader and SKOS:narrower.\nThree taxonomies are currently defined:"
